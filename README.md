This project contains firmware, scripts, and analysis tools for running experiments on the FIT IoT-Lab platform, focusing on 802.15.4 CSMA configurations behavior and their impact on the number of packet retransmissions, and how we can provide accurate predictions for unexplored configurations.

## Code Structure

### `code/` - Log Processing & Analysis

- **`preprocess_log.py`**: Converts experiment logs into structured JSON series.
- **`learn-combined-multiple-runs.py`**: Uses the generated series to evaluate prediction accuracy (MAE, MSE) for single-link, global, and k-NN models across various data splits.
- **`plot-results-split-boxplot.py`**: Generates comparative boxplots for different prediction approaches.
- **`plot_results.py`**: Plots model results focusing on the 70% training data split.
- **`print_common_configurations_table.py`**: Analyzes and prints statistics on retransmissions across common configurations.

### `code/expe/` - Experiment Firmware & Execution Scripts

- **`unicast-sender.c`**: Firmware for the sender node (M3) in FIT IoT-Lab.
- **`unicast-receiver.c`**: Firmware for the receiver node (M3) in FIT IoT-Lab.
- **`csma.c`**: CSMA implementation for Contiki-NG, modified to log retransmissions when `DEBUG=1`.
- **`exp-test-config.sh`**: Creates and configures an experiment, assigning firmware and parameters.
- **`run-exp.sh`**: Calls `exp-test-config.sh` with experiment parameters such as packet size.

### `data/` - Experiment Logs

- **`diff-config-long-*.txt`**: Raw logs from FIT IoT-Lab experiments, later processed for analysis.

## Usage

1. **Run the Experiment**  
   - Configure and launch an experiment with `run-exp.sh`, specifying parameters.
   - Firmware will execute on M3 nodes, logging transmissions and retransmissions.

2. **Process Logs**  
   - Convert logs into structured JSON using `preprocess_log.py`.

3. **Analyze Results**  
   - Train predictive models using `learn-combined-multiple-runs.py`.
   - Generate visualizations with `plot-results-split-boxplot.py` or `plot_results.py`.
   - Extract retransmission statistics with `print_common_configurations_table.py`.

## Dependencies

- **Contiki-NG** for CSMA experiments
- **FIT IoT-Lab** for deployment
- **Python (with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)** for analysis
